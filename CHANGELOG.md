- Correct generate code for structs with static array of structs, thanks @BlobCodes.

## [0.13.0] 2022-06-30

- Show if return value is nullable in generated code, helping debug.
- Implement virtual functions and allow including interfaces, thanks @BlobCodes (#26).
- Implement unsafe virtual functions, thanks @BlobCodes (#41).
- Implement user-transparent GObject enums, thanks @BlobCodes

### Changed

- Allow binding objects with functions named initialize/finalize, thanks @BlobCodes (#42)

## [0.12.0] 2022-06-04
### Added
- Signals can now be disconnected, `connect` method returns a `GObject::SignalConnection` object.
  - Disconnect signals from an object is important to let them be collected by the GC.
- Raises a compile time error if trying to inherit from a final GObject type.
- Initial support for user defined signals üéâÔ∏è, current supported parameter types are `Number`, `String` and `Boolean`.

### Changed
- `GLib::Bytes#data` now returns a `Slice(UInt8)` instead of `Enumerator(UInt8)`.
- `GLib::Bytes` constructor can accept any pointer + size in constructor, unsafe but doesn't copy data.
- Removed all `GObject::ParamSpec` subclasses, they don't need to be exposed in bindings, `GObject::ParamSpec` is enough.
- Requires crystal compiler version >= 1.4.1.

### Fixed
- Don't generate code for constructors with empty parameters (generic constructor will work).


## [0.11.0] 2022-05-18
### Added
- Allow user objects inheriting GObject to have custom constructors.
- Support signals with array of GObjects.
- Support signals with array of GObjetct Interfaces.
- Support signals with boxed structs.
- Support signals with enums.

### Fixed
- Avoid copy strings when creating quarks to store object qdata.
- Fix signals with nullable strings.
- Don't use `self` on method implementations, so they can be used in constructors before instance variables be set.

## [0.10.0] 2022-05-02
### Added
- Callback parameters are now supported.
- Fixed size array parameters raises `ArgumentError` if the size is less than the expected size.

### Fixed
- User classes can inherit from classes with size bigger than `GObject::Object` (e.g. `Gtk::Widget`).
- Methods with nilable handmade types (GValue/GVariant) in parameters now works.
- Strings in structs now works.
- Signals with return types now works.
- Methods named `initialize` are now correctly binded to `_initialize`, thanks @GeopJr.
- Fixed parameters of fixed size arrays.
- Fix `make doc`.

### Changed
- Wrapper instances are now re-used and shared, so all variables wrapping the same GObject now share the same address and hold
  just 1 reference to the GObject, this mean some things:

  - A lot less memory allocations! üéâÔ∏è.
  - Ordinary Crystal casts will work for Objects created from Crystal code and you rarely will need to use the `.cast` method.

## [0.9.0] 2022-04-17
### Added
- Add support to subclass a GObject üéâÔ∏è.

### Fixed
- Fixed memory leak in GObject proeprty constructors.
- Fixed crash when trying to free memory of C arrays in return values.
- Fixed problems with floating references.

## [0.8.0] 2022-04-14
### Added
- Module functions are generated.
- Very basic support for GObject subclassing.

### Fixed
- `g_main_context_invoke`, `g_main_context_invoke_full` and `g_closure_invoke` got the right `@[Raises]` annotation.
- Don't raise an exception if the C library creates an enum or flag with an invalid value (i.e. with reserved fields).
- Fix assignment of false value for boolean properties in constructor.
- Fixed problems with GObject float references.

### Changed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `GObject::ParamSpec` if back on bindings, so notify signals need to declare it again.
- Some more functions were removed from the bindings, see commit `bd3cf6a3f96c5cb60796ef11ccceea242f4625cb` and `2194662ca53648972787c507e0d5e010253f218b`.
- Removed ameba development dependency.

## [0.7.0] 2022-04-03
### Added
- Better code blocks in documentation, thanks @GeopJr.
- It's possible to add `@[Raises]` annotation on functiosn that can executa a callback, thanks @BlobCodes.

### Fixed
- Structs with non pointers struct attributes works as expected.
- Structs comparisson now are made by `memcmp`.
- Use the correct unref function for GLib types.
- Fix Makefile to work with parallel jobs.
- Generate interface signals.

## [0.6.0] 2022-03-02
### Changed
- Bump required Crystal version to 1.3.2 since I'm only testing with this version ü§∑Ô∏è.

### Fixed
- Fix signals with nullable parameters.
- Fix methods returning arrays of primitive types of any kind.

## [0.5.0] 2022-02-18
### Added
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Implement functions that return non-null terminated array of strings.
- Added bindings for GLib::Bytes.

### Changed
- Convert compare-api tool to Crystal and improve it a lot, it will be a good tool to detect patches that break the API üòéÔ∏è.
- Remove bindings for GLib `KeyFile` class, INI module in Crystal stdlib can replace it.

### Fixed
- `void*` return values in C are translated to `Pointer(Void)` instead of `Pointer(Nil)`.
- Constructors that may return `nil` now have the correct return type restriction.
- GObjetct flags with no elements are generated as a enum instead of a constant.

## [0.4.0] 2022-01-29
### Added
- Add `./bin/compare-api` script to compare APIs generated by two different versions of `gi-crystal`.
- Generate raw documentation for constants and enums.
- Print more GI annotations on generated code to ease debug.

### Changed
- Revert auto require of GObject module on gi-crystal since it makes the compiles require the file twice.

### Fixed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Fix binding of functions with GError and more than one parameter.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Constructor methods always return their own type despite the C function returns the parent type or not.

## [0.3.0] - 2022-01-23
### Changed
- Binding configuration now must be in binding.yml files.
- Command line no more need config paths, etc. gi-crystal can detect all bindings in the project and generate them.
- Need to run bin/gi-crystal manually before compile any project usign gi-crystal.
- Binding extra files are no longer copied into to generated output dir, but included directly.
- All generated files are now created under `lib/gi-crystal/src/auto/<module_dir>` by default.
- GError are now translated to Crystal exceptions.
- GLib/GObject bindings are required when `gi-crystal` is required.

## [0.2.0] - 2022-01-09
### Fixed
- Interfaces returned by methods can be used in GValues.
- Append `?` to property getters that starts with `is_`.
- Constructors with transfer none proper handle reference counting.
- Always use fully qualified names on property return types
