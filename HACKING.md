# HACKING

The generator is based on GObjectIntrospection, a C library that add introspection capabilities to C libraries based on GLib and GObject.

So the first thing you must know is that GI-Crystal itself has a binding for the _librepository_ (the library of GObjectIntrospection), this binding was created manually and must be kept this way to simplify the project.

The _librepository_ is only needed by the generator, the generated bindings doesn't depend on _librepository_.

The generator tries to create humam readable files to ease debug of the generated code.

## Directories

This is how the source is organized:

```
.
├── bin
├── ecr
├── spec
│   └── libtest
└── src
    ├── auto
    ├── bindings
    │   ├── g_lib
    │   └── g_object
    ├── generator
    ├── gi_crystal
    └── gobject_introspection
```

<dd>The generator uses ECR (Crystal equivalent of Ruby ERB) files, all ECR files used by the generator goes here.</dd>

</dl>

## Running tests

Executing `crystal spec` wont work because the generator wont find the libtest.so used by the tests, so instead of smash your head setting up a lot of environment variables you can just run:

```
make test
```

If you want to re-run a specific test without re-generate the bindings, i.e. you just changed the test code, you can run:

```
./bin/spec
```

It accepts the same parameters that `crystal spec` does.

## Comparing API changes

When you do some change to the generator code is useful to know the side effects of these changes in terms of a diff between what was being generated before and what is being generated now with the changes, for this there's a helper script `./bin/compare-api` that is available on shards that depend on gi-crystal.

If you want to use this script on gi-crystal itself you need to set some environment variables to let the generator find the libtest.so, etc. To help with this you can just use:

```
make compare
```

You you ran `make compare` already and want to just recompare the API with the newer changes you can do:

```
make recompare
```

## How GObject wrappers works

GICrystal use [g_object_set_qdata](https://docs.gtk.org/gobject/method.Object.set_qdata.html) function to store the Crystal
object pointer into every wrapper it creates, so it can restore the wraper object without need to re-allocate any memory.

When the wrapper is collected by the GC it reset this pointer to NULL, so if it appear again in the Crystal world we create
another wrapper for it. See `Crystal::INSTANCE_QDATA_KEY` constant.

For user made objects inheriting GObject a [toggle ref](https://docs.gtk.org/gobject/method.Object.add_toggle_ref.html) is
added to the GObject, so the object it's garbage collected only if there's no references for it in C world. This is done at
`src/bindings/g_object/object.cr`, look for `_add_toggle_ref`.

## How Struct wrappers works

Currently it creates a wrapper with a copy of the struct always... i.e. it's slow.

### Plan for near future

Check if the struct have no pointers to objects in their fields, is so, bind it directly to a Crystal struct, so it will be as fast as in C to use these structs in Crystal.
